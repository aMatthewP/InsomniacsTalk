						<h4 class="info-title">Improved Stream Layout </h4>
						<p>We improved the layout of our second stream, making our stream's starting/waiting 
							screen more appealing and animated by adding an image of an owl that blinks. 
							For our main screen, we made it less cluttered and more straightforward for our audience to view. 
							We said our socials and name at the top of the screen and our topic at the bottom. 
							Finally, we added an ending stream to show the audience that the stream was over. 
							The ending stream was a simple message and an image of a penguin sleeping. 
							Additionally, our artist decided to spark individuality among the hosts by branching out with the 
							color palettes and using various shades of different colors (e.g., blue, pink, green) to give the audience 
							a better grasp of the hosts' personalities. 
							This ensures a pop of color and directs everyone to the avatars.

						<h4 class="info-title">Better Audio Quality </h4>
						<p>We also had better audio quality for all the stream participants. Unlike last time, when Kim's noise suppression made his audio quite unclear, this time around, everyone's mic quality was better and more understandable, creating a much more pleasant listening experience.</p>

						<h4 class="info-title">Flow & Topics</h4>
						<p>
							Unlike last time, when we had no script prepared, we created a script days before our stream. Although we only partially followed the script by having improvised moments when asking chat questions and interacting with them, overall, the flow and topics of the stream were smoother than last time. We could focus more on our main topic than secondary topics such as school life.

						<h4 class="info-title">No Technical Difficulties</h4>
						<p>
							In our previous stream, there were technical difficulties regarding setting up audio during the beginning of the stream, which was why we were late and the end of the stream where we could not end immediately because our streaming software was unresponsive. Having an ending stream scene during that time would make the ending stream process much less noticeable to the audience. Our streaming software was responsive this time, and there were no technical issues during the stream.

						<h4 class="info-title">Added Background Music</h4>
						<p>
							We added background music to our second stream to fill the dead air and make the listening experience while waiting for the stream to start more pleasant. This was a minor but impactful change because it helped carry on the flow of the conversation even if no one was talking.

								<p>
									Although our use of Tagalog during the second stream was much less than the first stream, there were still moments when one of our hosts used Tagalog instead of English (to read out answers/questions from the chat or answer questions). Although we did use Tagalog when reading the messages in the chat box, that is an understandable time to use Tagalog.

								<h4 class="info-title">How It Affected Our Stream Overall</h4>
								<p>
									Our level of engagement is high; our maximum number of viewers is 12. This affects the overall engagement as it makes the viewers more active in the comment section, and many audiences engage more in the discussion. Due to the organization of the stream outline, we smoothly executed everything needed for the stream. Through it all, we have a high engagement rate due to the layout being less cluttered, the topics being on point, and the members actively promoting the promotional materials in our personal social media accounts and sharing the link with various groups we are in. The hosts encouraged everyone to participate and share their experiences and insights after every topic, and the hosts also did a question and answer session so that the audience could absorb more of the information and the topic we had.

										<h4 class="info-title">Description</h4>
										<p>
											We accumulated a maximum of 12 viewers and an average of 7, which is lower than the viewership status of our first podcast. However, most of our viewers are the same viewers that we had on our first episode of the podcast. The day and time we chose our stream were unfortunate because the majority of the other groups were also streaming or preparing for their stream on that day, so many of our target audience of Grade 10 students of APEC Sta. Rita was preoccupied with setting up their stream.
