			<h1>I. Summary of Stream</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our live stream was about the effects of sleep deprivation on the academic performance of the Grade 10 students of APEC Sta. Rita. It aired on February 4, 2024, and was broadcast to YouTube on our channel Insomniacs Talk. The live streaming software we used was OBS, and our special guest for the stream was the treasurer of the APEC Sta. Rita student council, Jewel Geslani, and the hosts of the stream were Akio Pangan and Kim Monte. At the same time, the chat moderators were Pio Dimayuga, Christian Gacosta, and Anton Claus. Then, our artists who created the stream layouts and avatars were Alliyah Lorenzo and Bernice Gadia.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our waiting time for the stream, we were off schedule by around 1 minute and 30 seconds. During the beginning of our stream, while waiting for our guest to arrive, we were talking about things that were unrelated to our topic but relevant to the academic lives of our target audience, which are APEC Students, such as the upcoming fun week event. We also interacted with our viewers by asking them questions and planning activities after the stream. At the end of our stream, we summarized everything for our viewers to remember, like the tips and tricks we gave, the negative effects of sleep deprivation, and some sleep hygiene habits they should try to fix their sleep schedule. We also had difficulties ending the stream; even though we had already said goodbye to our audiences and ended the discussion, our stream was still running and visible to the viewers.

			<h1>II. Things well done during the stream</h1>
			<p>
 Stream Layout - The stream layout and templates worked excellently during the streaming process. We executed what we had planned for our streaming layout well, and it ran smoothly, except for our channel’s name in the background.
 <br>
 <br>
Audience Engagement - We engaged with the audience of our stream from start to finish, and all of our conversations were related to sleep deprivation, which is our topic. Initially, we mentioned school events such as Fun Week since it was related to the academic lives of our target audience. 
Other things said throughout the stream related to our topic.
 <br>
 <br>
Topics mentioned -  Although we had no prepared script, we still had a general outline of what would happen in the stream and what questions we would ask our guest. We discussed our topic for our stream. We talked about sleep deprivation, its effects on students, sleep hygiene, and what practices one could implement to get a better sleeping schedule. We were also able to ask our guest all of the questions that we had planned, and we were able to discuss her sleeping schedule and habits. 
<br>
<br>
Conclusion <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, part II of our streaming analysis paper discussed the three things well done during the stream. The preparations that we created significantly affected the outcome of our stream. The stream layout we came up with is the product of shared ideas and tons of drafts to relate our stream layout with our topic, from the color palette to the avatars to the chat playback and clear audio. That alone is interpreted more specifically through chat. How responsive they were to the host’s commentary and discussion allowed us to gain more viewers, thus helping spread our stream. We successfully discussed the topic for our stream, namely sleep deprivation. We explored the effects of sleep deprivation on students and shared practices one could implement to get a better sleeping schedule.

			<h1>III. Areas Of Opportunities</h1>
			<p>
Use of Tagalog/Filipino—In some parts of our stream, Akio and Kim used Tagalog to communicate and interact with each other, especially with the viewers. Ms. Bleazy noticed that when she entered our Live Stream, they were not aware that it was not allowed to be used during the stream. That’s what we think we need to improve on our next stream if we are given a chance to do it again.
<br>
<br>
Beginning of the Stream - During the beginning of the stream, we were delayed by 1 minute and 30 seconds due to some technical issues Kim and Akio were having. Although there was no timer on the screen indicating when our stream was starting, the hosts should still have been on time and followed the stream outline we had prepared. 
<br>
<br>
Delayed entry of guest - Our guest's introduction was delayed by a few minutes because her device ran out of battery. Although this issue was unexpected, it is still something we need to be cautious about in the future. The next stream part of our preparation before the stream should include the guests' connection and devices. Since our podcast is held virtually, we must be extremely careful in checking everyone’s devices before the stream.
<br>
<br>
End of the stream - At the end of the stream, we were not able to end our stream immediately. Many people in the chat also noticed we had trouble ending the stream. This was because Kim, the one who was broadcasting the stream, had issues with his streaming software. His OBS could not correctly end the stream because it was not responding. The stream ran for around 1 minute and 20 seconds before we could end it. Although this was entirely out of our hands, it is still something we need to avoid in the future.
<br>
<br>
Audio devices - Some of our audio devices, mainly Kim's, were hard to hear due to his use of Discord and mic noise suppression. This resulted in Kim’s audio being very unclear and low. In the future, we must ensure that our audio quality is acceptable to our audience. Getting a better mic or avoiding the use of noise suppression may help in getting better audio quality.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the main problem in our stream was the delays in some parts of it. This was caused by poor communication between participants and unresponsive streaming software. We also used Tagalog in our stream, which would have made the stream inaccessible for some viewers and was a critique our LF gave. Another aspect of the stream that could have done better was the audio quality of one of the hosts. In the future, we want to make the listening and viewing experience as straightforward as possible while avoiding unnecessary delays and the use of Tagalog.

			<h1>IV. Level Of Engagement Of The Stream and How It Affected Its Overall Performance.</h1>
			<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our level of engagement is high but at a lower peak. Our minimum number of viewers is 5, and the comment sections are active during our stream. From our observation,  the waiting time before the main discussion started took too long, and the audience got bored during the conversation with our guest. Through it all, we gained 14 - 17 viewers at maximum. Due to the rise in viewership, the stream became livelier, with the chat engaging and commenting throughout the conversation. We have a high engagement rate because we actively promote our stream on social media platforms. Our promotional materials contain engaging captions, and the design is very relevant. For this reason, we can come up with high engagement.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we share our stream links through different groups that we are in. Another reason why we have such high engagement is how playful and welcoming the hosts are to the chat and the audience. They encourage everyone to speak to them through chat while also playing jokes, making the stream far more casual. Thus, they are approachable to the viewers.

		<section class="viewership-status">
			<h1>V. Viewership Status: High Or Low</h1>
			<p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Maximum viewers are 14-17. The number of viewers we had was high compared to the other streamers. This can be due to the effects and designs we added,  for example, how the avatars work when the hosts speak. Or how the background of the stream moved, like a satisfying GIF. Another reason is that we shared our stream link with friends who wanted to support and were curious about our discussion topic, “Sleep Deprivation and How It Affects Students' Academic Performance.” Most of our audience were people who supported our hosts (Akio and Kim) and our guest (Jewel). Another factor is our promotion, as some of us are rather popular or have an extensive internet circle, which reaches a curious audience.
